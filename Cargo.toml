# Until bdk depends on a version of rust-miniscript (likely v4.1) that includes this commit: https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-miniscript/commit/f43f7e6edd06ac659500eb8177ef300e49affe92
miniscript = { git = "https://github.com/coblox/rust-miniscript", branch = "wasm-bdk" }
# Until next version with secp256k1 0.20 is released. This purposely points to a branch that backports this change to the 0.25.2 tag to avoid compilation errors in miniscript.
